Today was a really {adjective1} day at school. My teacher, {teacher_name}, gave us a surprise quiz!
Right when I opened my {noun1}, I accidentally {verb1} all over the classroom.
Everyone started laughing and the principal came from the {place} to see what happened.

He looked so {adjective2} when he heard me shout "{silly_word}!".
